### Hello there 👋

My name is Nick and I am interested in most topics Computer and Technology related. Most of my work deals with Information Technology, Asset Management, Web Development, and Application Security. Currently working on Capture The Flag events and Certifications. I am interested in creating curriculum for K-12 learning, CTF training, Application and Server Pentesting, Cloud, Bug Bounty, and Red/Blue/Purple team concepts like Adversary Emulation.
